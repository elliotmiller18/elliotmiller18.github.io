    <h2>Week of 11/17</h2>
    <p>
      This week, we saw major quality of life changes to UI and controls, as well as big visibility updates. We significantly improved the upgrading buildings mechanic and also added a new path system that allow the player to choose perks that help specific areas of their base (production, defense, etc.) We had a lot of feedback about how clunky the controls felt, so a big focus of ours this week was streamlining user experience.

      We also felt like the tower defense aspect of our tower defense city builder game was way too prominent, so our changes this week focused mainly on improving the resource management components of the game, as well as giving players more satisfying ways to use their resources. We will continue with this philosophy moving forward, making more interesting upgrades, ramping up the scale of the path system, and introducing new negative events beyond just being attacked by chimps.

    <h2>Week of 11/24</h2>
    <p>
      First, we added a title screen that has animated leaves pulling apart, enhancing the jungle atmosphere. We’ve adjusted the wave spawning system to trigger less often, with a long countdown timer to give players enough time to prepare for incoming waves. A wave tutorial was introduced, featuring a single enemy near the player’s first tower, which helps new players understand the gameplay without directly telling them. In terms of UI/UX, we’ve added a sidebar for better building management, greying out locked buildings, switching from shift-click to right-click for building info, repositioned the gameplay screen for proper centering, and made sure the player has easy access to building upgrades. We’ve also improved visual feedback by adding particle effects for upgrades, enemy attacks, and deaths. A color gradient was added to building health and a chimp health bar to help players gauge their progress. Additionally, background music, attack/death sound effects, and a building placement sound effect were integrated to make the game more immersive. The player now starts with fewer monkeys but can buy more, which balances progression. We’ve also changed monkey allocation to be more intuitive with left-click controls to make the game more mouse heavy instead of relying on shift-click.

      These changes aim to enhance the overall player experience of the game. The addition of clearer visual cues (like particle effects and health bars) and audio feedback helps players understand game events, while the new tutorial ensures new players can easily understand core mechanics. The gameplay balance has been adjusted to give players better pacing, especially with the revised wave system and monkey buying feature. Moving towards a more mouse-driven control scheme was a conscious decision to streamline interactions and make the game feel smoother. We’re focused on making the game more immersive and easier to play while slowly building up a variety of gameplay mechanics. In the next iteration, we plan to introduce more defense buildings and a resource booster building and additional enemy types to increase the challenge. We will continue refining the tutorial and UI elements to ensure clarity for new players. We also plan on improving the look of our game and using more polished UI features.
