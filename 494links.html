    This week, we saw major quality of life changes to UI and controls, as well as big visibility updates. We significantly improved the upgrading buildings mechanic and also added a new path system that allow the player to choose perks that help specific areas of their base (production, defense, etc.) We had a lot of feedback about how clunky the controls felt, so a big focus of ours this week was streamlining user experience.

	We also felt like the tower defense aspect of our tower defense city builder game was way too prominent, so our changes this week focused mainly on improving the resource management components of the game, as well as giving players more satisfying ways to use their resources. We will continue with this philosophy moving forward, making more interesting upgrades, ramping up the scale of the path system, and introducing new negative events beyond just being attacked by chimps.
